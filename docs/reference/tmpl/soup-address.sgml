<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
SoupAddress

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Higher-level IP address object

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
#SoupAddress represents the address of a TCP connection endpoint; both
the IP address and the port. (It is somewhat like an object-oriented
version of struct #sockaddr.)
</para>

<para>
If libsoup was built with IPv6 support, #SoupAddress will allow both
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
</para>

</para>

<!-- ##### ENUM SoupAddressFamily ##### -->
<para>
The supported address families. Note that the
%SOUP_ADDRESS_FAMILY_IPV6 constant is available even if libsoup was
built without IPv6 support, but attempting to create an IPv6 address
will fail in that case.
</para>

@SOUP_ADDRESS_FAMILY_IPV4: an IPv4 address
@SOUP_ADDRESS_FAMILY_IPV6: an IPv6 address

<!-- ##### MACRO SOUP_ADDRESS_ANY_PORT ##### -->
<para>
This can be passed to any #SoupAddress method that expects a port to
indicate that you don't care what port is used.
