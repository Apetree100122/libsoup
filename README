Soup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part of
a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation, but most of the
SOAP code has since been removed.

Soup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK
applications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
the Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
supported for those who want it).

Soup also contains code to implement an HTTP/1.1 server.

Features:
  * (Optionally) completely asynchronous
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
