TODO:
====

* Thread safety (started)

* Documentation (API, tutorial)

* Use gconf for config data (especially proxy info)

* Bring back WSDL compiler from old soup module?

* Bring back SOCKS support?

* Bring back CGI server support? (Split SoupServer into SoupServerTCP
  and SoupServerCGI)

* Handle gzip Content-Encoding

* Add a SoupMessageFilter implementation to handle cookies (RFC 2965)

* Add a SoupMessageFilter implementation to handle caching (rcd has
  some of the logic for this already).

* More regression tests

* Add apache config files to tests/ so that apache can be run locally
  to run regression tests against

* Merge soup-server-auth.c with the client auth implementation.
  Likewise, make soup-server-message.c less of a hack.

* User-Agent handling: caller should specify a User-Agent string to
  SoupSession, and soup should automatically append libsoup/#.## to
  that. (Likewise for Server/Via headers.)

* Explicit range support (?)

* NTLM Proxy-Authentication support, GSS-Negotiate support

* Pipelining


Known bugs:
==========

* Digest auth does not support qop="auth-int" (both client and server)

* Trailers in chunked responses are not handled

* simple-proxy is not very RFC compliant
