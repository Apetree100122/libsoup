	* Split libsoup out of soup. ChangeLog.old contains the original
	soup ChangeLog.

	* Makefile.am, etc: Fix things up to work with the new directory
	layout. Disable docs until we fix them.

	* autogen.sh: Use gnome-autogen.sh

	* configure.in: Require autoconf 2.53. Remove stuff that was only
	needed for httpd or wsdl code. Remove glib1 support. Bump version
	to 2.0.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Rename library to libsoup-2.0, put includes
	in ${includedir}/soup-2.0
	
	* libsoup/*: Merge soup-0-7 back onto the trunk. Remove
	SOAP-specific stuff, Windows support, and other things that
	weren't being maintained.

	* soup-config.in, soupConf.sh: Kill these. We only support
	pkg-config now.
