	* tests/cgi-test.c: 
	* tests/mod-server-test.c:

	that sets the errorphrase, add some response headers, and prints
	the request body, uri, and headers in the response.

	* src/soup-httpd/soup-httpd.c: Update for new server api, remove
	module reloading, which trivializes the server code.

	* src/libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_cleanup): If still
	reading response, reset the SoupReader's callbacks to only release
	(on finish) or release and close (on error) the connection,
	instead of terminating the read which could leave data in the
	socket to to hork future messages which use this connection.  Also
	NULL the message's references to the connection and SoupReader so
	that they are not disposed of on message free.

        parameter to avoid magic values in content_length. Switch on
        encoding to see if read completed. Use issue_final_callback ().

	* src/soup-core/soup-socket.c (soup_address_new): Perform deep
	unix magic in order to identify if we are running in a
	debugger. This is needed because gdb causes segfaults in child
	processes that load shlibs due to breakpoints being left over in

	everything works perfectly both inside and outside of gdb.

	and recreate them with a non-existant soup-wsdl when I type "make
	distcheck".

	* Makefile.am: Took tests out of SUBDIRS, added a "make examples"
	target instead.

	* src/soup-wsdl/wsdl-soap-stubs.c: replace all SoupFault

2001-05-04  Dick Porter  <dick@ximian.com>

	* src/soup-wsdl-runtime/wsdl-schema.c: Decide which schema parser to
	call for a WSDL <types> section. This supercedes the old glib schema

	* src/soup-core/soup-socket.h: SoupSocketConnectFn no longer takes
	a SoupAddress argument, as it can be fetched from the SoupSocket
	correctly now.

	* src/soup-core/soup-socket.c: lots of rewrites. Cache existing
	SoupAddresses to avoid duplicate lookups. Handles multiple
	simultaneous requests for the same address. Add syncronous

	and STDOUT to point to the fd we will return a GIOChannel for,
	also passing the security policy and the destination socket fd
	number in the environments SECURITY_POLICY and SOCKFD,
	respectively.

	* src/soup-core/soup-ssl-proxy.c: Created. This is a small SSL
	proxy executable, licensed GPL, which allows us to use OpenSSL and

	code for functions common to stubs and skels.

	* src/soup-wsdl/wsdl-memory.[ch]: New file of routines to
	recursively free WSDL structures.

	* src/soup-wsdl/wsdl-locate.[ch]: New file of routines to look up

	(wsdl_parse_porttype_operation): Tell the difference between a
	request-response operation and a solicit-response operation.

	build an xmlDocPtr tree, yet still fill in the WSDL structures as
	the XML is being read.
	(wsdl_parse): Set up the SAX parser so it calls the internal
	libxml tree building routines, except for those elements that I
	use to build WSDL structures. These elements must call the
	corresponding xmlDefaultSAXHandler functions themselves.

	(main): Call code generation routines

	* src/soup-wsdl/Makefile.am: Added a lot of new files

	one is loaded successfully. Attempts to start NSS then OpenSSL, then
	simply fails gracefully for future SSL connections.
	(soup_ssl_get_iochannel): dispatch to the underlying SSL library
	in use, or return NULL if none are available.

	* src/soup-core/soup-misc.c (soup_load_config_internal): Converted

	(soup_queue_write_async): attempt to write again if the first
	write was okay and didn't block.

	* src/soup-core/soup-uri.c (soup_debug_print_uri): make public.

	* src/soup-core/soup-message.c (soup_message_issue_callback):
	message callback now returns void, meaning that soup_queue_message()
	takes ownership of the message and always frees it after calling
	the callback (unless it was requeued from within the callback).

	* src/soup-core/soup-headers.c (soup_headers_parse_request):
	renamed from soup_parse_request_headers.
	(soup_headers_parse_response): renamed from soup_parse_response_headers.

	that data available in the socket does not always mean unencrypted
	data is available for reading.
	(soup_ssl_read_cb): called on socket data available. Only call the

	check for SOCKS protocol, remove call to soup_setup_socket.

	* src/soup-core/soup-context.c (soup_connection_get_iochannel):

	* soup-queue.c: change default Content-Type to "text/xml" from
	  "text/xml\r\n\tcharset=\"utf-8\"".

	* soup-serializer.[ch]: added soup_serializer_new_full which
	  removes unnecessary args to soup_serializer_start_envelope. 
	  rearrange namespace args to soup_serializer_start_element to match 
	  other methods. added soup_serializer_set_type to set the xsi:type,
	  and soup_serializer_set_null to set xsi:null="1".

	  req->response_phrase.

	* src/soup-core/soup-serializer.h: include <time.h>

2001-01-31  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@ximian.com>

	* src/soup-core/gionspr.c: Implemented (probably somewhat broken).

2001-01-25  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	$cflags

2001-01-23  alex  <alex@ximian.com>

	* ChangeLog: Created from rcs2log.

	* AUTHORS: Added Dick Porter.

	* soup.pc.in, soup-config.in, soupConf.sh, soup.m4:
	Created with a dash of Maintainer Love.

	* soup.spec.in: RPM spec file. Needs fixing wrt to displaying the
	OpenSSL license conditionally (if it was statically linked).

	* Makefile.am: Updated to install new config scripts and macros.

	* configure.in: add --enable-ssl, --with-ssl=[nss/openssl/none],
	and --with-nss-prefix=PFX to support choosing of an SSL library to
	use, even though openssl is the only one currently supported.

	* src/soup-core/Makefile.am: don't install soup-ssl.h or
	soup-socks.h, they're internal.

	* src/soup-core/soup-ssl.c: wrap openssl calls with a conditional
	to avoid building if --enable-ssl=no or NSS is chosen as the
	library. soup_get_ssl_iochannel() will print "SSL Not Supported."
	and return NULL if no library has been chosen.

	* tests/stress-test.c: make the callback handle errors by
	requeuing request and not just g_error'ing.

	* soup-context.c (soup_context_get_connection): check environment
	for SOUP_NO_ASYNC_CONNECT, and if set use syncronous name lookup
	and connect. Use this when debugging.

	* soup-queue.c (soup_read_chunk): fix buffer overflow.

	* soup-queue.c (soup_queue_read_async): set header_len to include
	trailing \r\n\r\n as this makes more sense.

	* soup-serializer.[ch] (soup_serializer_get_xml_doc): allows
	getting at the serializer's internal xml tree.

	* soup.h: install soup-serializer.h.

	User-specified types are not yet supported.

2001-01-17  alex  <alex@ximian.com>

	* src/soup-serializer.c (soup_serializer_start_element): handle
	cases where users want to be lazy and supply a namespace prefix
	but not a uri (i.e. broken xml).

	* src/soup-misc.c (soup_load_config_internal): warn the user if a
	config file entry is not allowed by system config.

	* src/soup-serializer.[ch]: initial commit of simple serializer
	API. Uses libxml to handle tree creation.

	* configure.in: check for libxml.

2001-01-15  alex  <alex@ximian.com>

	* src/soup-misc.c: Fix a typo

	* src/soup-misc.c: hacked to support permissions in the global
	config file on which options can be set from user config
	files. Global config file is now always loaded first, before
	either a program specified file or the user's dot-file. Also
	supports "allow all" and "deny all" which have the expected
	results.

	* src/soup-ssl.[ch]: move unneeded #include's to the source file.

	* soup-socks.c: Umm, ya. So I was like umm, sleepy last night and
	stuff. So this umm makes last night's commit a little less
	embarrassing.

2001-01-14  alex  <alex@ximian.com>

	* src/soup-misc.c: oops, forgot to mention that user local config
	file (~/.souprc) is now loaded after the system config file. This
	needs to be thought out more as administrators may not want
	variables overwritten.

	* src/soup-socks.[ch]: SOCKS version 4 and version 5 support. This
	code is not very simple because we are attempting to make a
	multi-step conversation completely asyncronous. Also this includes
	a hack to get at GNET's GInetAddr private memebers (the
	sockaddr_in) for SOCKS4, as the client has to lookup the
	destination host address and send it to the socks proxy, and we
	want to use gnet to do this asyncronously.

	* src/soup-context.[ch]: Added soup_context_get_protocol(),
	soup_connection_get_context(), and soup_connection_is_new() so
	that we can keep the abstractions between the contexts/connections
	and messages clean. soup_context_get_uri() changed to return a
	SoupUri instead of a string, as this is more useful. Made
	SoupProtocol a public enum so it can be returned by
	soup_context_get_protocol().

	* src/soup-queue.c: updated to use context/connection accessors,
	instead of looking at private members. AB-STRAC-SHUN!

2001-01-12  alex  <alex@ximian.com>

        * soup-misc.c (soup_load_config): simple config file
	loading. Passing NULL as the config file name will load from the
	system config file, which is $(sysconfdir)/souprc. Only options
	supported now are proxy-url and connection-limit.

	* */.cvsignore: a little maintainer love.

2001-01-11  alex  <alex@ximian.com>

	* soup-queue.c (soup_get_request_header): append a '?' between
	path and query string in request header. NULL terminate the call
	to g_strconcat.

	* soup-context.c (soup_context_get): bomb if url passed in does
	not have a protocol. do not default to HTTP.

	SoupMessage.

	* /cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-ssl.c,
	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-queue.c: * soup-ssl.c
	(soup_ssl_add_watch): make ssl work. pass the ssl iochannel to the
	underlying iochannel's funcs->io_add_watch, so that our ssl
	functions get called. this is a hack. this will need to be fixed
	in order to get windows portability, as the SoupSSLChannel struct
	is mimicing GIOUnixChannel so the add_watch will work correctly.

	* soup-queue.c (soup_queue_read_async): fix bug when searching for
	end of http headers where req->priv->header_len was being set
	whether the end was found or not.

	chunked encoding support finalized, fixed a few small buffer over
	allocations, use strcasecmp instead of strcmp when comparing
	custom request headers, better error handling in
	soup_queue_error_async which fixes a bug found in certain IIS
	servers.

	* soup-context.c: (soup_connection_get_iochannel) return iochannel
	from soup-ssl.c:soup_get_ssl_iochannel() if protocol for
	connection is SOUP_PROTOCOL_SHTTP.

	* soup-ssl.c: simple GIOChannel wrapper around the OpenSSL
	library.

	Content length is now a guint.

	* soup-queue.c (soup_parse_headers): Added minimum status-line
	length check.

	* soup-queue.c (soup_queue_request): Removed g_error() call for
	user-iwned response buffers. We now just issue a
	SOUP_ERROR_CANCELLED callback and print a warning.

	* /cvs/helixcode/services/soup/tests/Makefile.am,
	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/tests/stress-test.c: * Added
	tests/stress-test.c which makes 3 simultaneous requests to a url,
	each repeating 110 times (enough to trigger Apache to kill
	keep-alive connections), goes to sleep for 20 seconds (long enough
	for Apache to kill keep-alive connections again) and repeats. It
	also sets the connection limit to 2.

	* /cvs/helixcode/services/soup/tests/simple-test.c: *
	SOUP_ERROR_UNKNOWN has been removed. Don't check for it.

	(soup_uri_new): Forgot to set the path for cases where we don't

	* soup-uri.c (soup_uri_get_default_port): No such thing as an

	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-uri.c,
	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-uri.h: * Beginnings of
	test-suite added.

	* Made SoupContext opaque. Removed SoupContextPrivate. Added
	soup_context_get_uri() to get the uri string for a given context.

	* Added a response_headers hashtable to SoupRequest so the
	callback can do whatever it wants with passed headers. All entries
	in this hashtable are just parsed strings from
	req->priv->recv_buf, so no new strings are allocated.

	* Renamed custom_headers to request_headers

	* Fixed context creation logic

	* Made soup_servers hashtable use case insensitive hostname
	matching.

	* Removed SOUP_ERROR_URI_NOT_FOUND, SOUP_ERROR_URI_NOT_PERMITTED,
	and SOUP_ERROR_URI_OBJECT_MOVED from SoupCallbackResult enum. Its
	up to the application to figure out all the different HTTP
	states. This may change however.

	* Added querystring to SoupUri, so that contexts can be cached
	based only on path.

	* Added default port logic to SoupUri. Known protocols are https
	(port 443), http (80), smtp/mailto (25), and ftp (20).

	* /cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-context.c,

	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-context.h,
	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-queue.c,
	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-request.c: * Internal rehash
	of handling cases where the connection limit is reached, involves
	setting a timeout event source to check for the ability to create
	a connection, and allowing either the timeout or the gnet connect
	routine to be canceled depending on the current connect
	state. Clients should now use soup_context_cancel_connect() to
	cancel a connection in progress.

	* /cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-queue.c: * Don't use glibc
	sscanf extensions.

2000-12-11  alex  <alex@ximian.com>

	* /cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-queue.c: Better error
	checking on HTTP response line. Avoid doing a lookup for every
	used header by iterating the hash table and doing a strcmp for all
	known headers. This is not necessarily faster for several cases,
	but it allows us to gather custom headers at the same time and
	avoid a second iteration.

	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-request.h,
	/cvs/helixcode/services/soup/src/soup-uri.h: * Rewrote the
	connection pool logic, and cleaned up the request queueing loop.

	* Added ref/unref to SoupContext.

	* Made getting a connection for a SoupContext generic which cleans
	up the code and makes it useable for purposes other than soup.

	* Connection limits handling moved to the connection pooling to
	avoid races, and allows for better handling when we have hit the
	connection limit.

	* Added soup-misc.[ch] which provide global functions for getting
	and setting the proxy context and the connection limit.

	* Changed proxy to be a SoupContext.

	* Support for http headers near completion.

	* Added support for custom request headers which can override the
	standard headers without duplication.

	* Lots of code reorg and cleaning up.
